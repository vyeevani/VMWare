# VMWare
Machine learning use cases on VMWare high performance GPU cluster

Style Transfer
  - An application of neural network that adds the content of one image with the style of another
  - Demonstrates the speed of the GPU for prebuilt models like the VGG16 model thats used inside it
  - Attached iPython notebooks contain graphs for distrubted tensorflow on nvidia server cards
    vs standard tensorflow on Nvidia server cards vs standard tensorflow on remote workstation
  - Just a first trial of what the cards can do using a standard neural network application
